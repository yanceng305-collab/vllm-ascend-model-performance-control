# Decisions

## D-001 Control scope

This repository is a native vLLM-Ascend model performance baseline Control plane. It is not a FlagOS adaptation repository and does not contain implementation forks.

## D-002 User normalization policy

For comparable higher-is-better metrics, the minimum target is `H100 metric * (Ascend comparable system compute / H100 comparable system compute) * 0.80`. For lower-is-better metrics, use the inverse latency formulation only when the approved benchmark contract explicitly makes that metric a gate. This is a User-defined performance acceptance heuristic, not a claim that theoretical compute ratios equal end-to-end LLM performance.

## D-003 No guessed inputs

Unknown model/runtime/hardware/compute/workload values remain unknown until supported by User materials, runtime inventory, or an auditable official source. Missing comparable compute prevents a normalized target from being calculated.

## D-004 No execution at bootstrap

Bootstrap performs no A3/NPU operation, package installation, model launch, or benchmark. Codex2 execution requires a READY Task and explicit User dispatch.

## D-005 FlagOS-aligned version baseline

The primary baseline is `flagos-ai/vllm-plugin-FL@release/0.2` aligned to `vLLM 0.20.2` and `vLLM-Ascend 0.20.2rc1`, with the compatibility-row Python/CANN/PyTorch/torch_npu/Triton/Mooncake constraints recorded in `methodology/VERSION-BASELINE.md`. Newer versions are not silently substituted.

## D-006 Dual performance tracks

`FLAGOS_ALIGNED` is the formal migration baseline. `LATEST_REFERENCE` is a separately labeled `NON_FLAGOS_ALIGNED_REFERENCE` for support/blocker investigation only; it cannot replace, mix with, or pass the aligned lane.

## D-007 Fact ownership

Codex1 retrieves public facts. Codex2 retrieves server-observable facts after User dispatch through a read-only Stage 0 Task. User is asked only for policy, private material, authorization, engineering-reference approval, or true business decisions.

## D-008 Comparison classes

Use `STRICT_REFERENCE`, `ENGINEERING_REFERENCE`, or `NOT_COMPARABLE`. Platform implementation parameters may differ; workload semantics and metric definitions remain the comparability contract.

## D-009 Stage 0 boundary

Stage 0 is read-only/non-destructive Server Fact Acquisition and Compatibility Discovery. Stateful preparation, model launch, and benchmark require separate dispatched Tasks and explicit User authorization.
